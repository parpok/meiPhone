#  Me

This app was my "get back to doing SwiftUI layouts" project.I've tried making something that looks like if a CV/Portfolio was an iPhone app

Things used:

- async image
- lists
- custom views
- silly mindset 

This was initially made in SwiftPlaygrounds and I did it a bit lazyly so the entire code is in one file which is bad for manageability
